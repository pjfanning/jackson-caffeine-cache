# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

By default, only the latest version of the library is supported. Security patches may be backported to older versions, but only in exceptional circumstances.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

* Suspected security vulnerabilities should not be discussed publicly. Do not open an issue using the normal issue tracker.
* Create your own fork of this project
* Create a [Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/creating-a-security-advisory) in your fork. Do not worry about getting all the settings correct initially.
* [Grant access](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/adding-a-collaborator-to-a-security-advisory) to the my username (pjfanning) so that I can see the description of the issue and comment.
* If I accept that there is a vulnerability, I move the Security Advisory to this project and add all the parties from the fork advisory as collaborators.
* I will try to get a fix, a release and CVE assignment done as quickly as I can.
